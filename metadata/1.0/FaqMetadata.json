            "Question": "How safe is my master-password?",
            "Answer": "Very. Your master-password never even reaches our servers. That's one of the advantages of client-side encryption."
        },
        {
            "Question": "How complicated should my master-password be?",
            "Answer": "As complicated as you can make it and still remember it."
        },
        {
            "Question": "What kind of encryption do you use?",
            "Answer": "AES Ciphers - which is considered pretty good according to people who understand cryptography way better than I do"

            "Question": "How do we trust you(Passman)?",

            "Question": "What happens if I forget my master-password?",
            "Answer": "Nothing great. You will lose your saved passwords, secrets, and files on Passman. We cannot help you recover your data because, like we said, we literally cannot read your data."
